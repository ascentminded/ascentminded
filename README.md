Hi, I’m Ascent, I’m interested in data analysis, automation and the development of neuromorphic technology. I’m currently learning about Spiking Neural Nets, but I've worked with DNNs, CNNs, and a fair amount of ML.
Still haven't figured out the coder mindset, since I've self taught myself on a use-case by use-case principle.
